## Common Questions

**Q: Why don't the charts show up?**  
A: Make sure you analyze first! Analytics need data.

**Q: Can I see multiple analyses at once?**  
A: Yes! Perform another analysis, then check the Comparison tab.

**Q: What if I'm missing a skill?**  
A: It'll show in the "Missing Skills" section with recommendations.

**Q: Can I download the raw data?**  
A: Yes! Use JSON export for all data.

**Q: Why do scores change when I reanalyze?**  
A: Because they're based on the resume-JD match. Different JD = different scores.
